*Based on the client requirement you can develop according to client requirements
*You released version of the appliation
*One year later, the client comes to you and asks to change the options in the application.
*But the application got failed, in this case you can rollback to the specific previous version

*Git is a distributed version control system

Git tracks changes you made, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions it makes collection easily allowing changes by people to all merged into one source.
